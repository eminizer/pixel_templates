# SiPixel Template/GenError Uploader
====================================

This code produces pixel template and generr sqlite db files by uploading template files and associating each detID with a template.

Checkout Instructions & Environment setup
=========================================

Currently not yet integrated into CMSSW, so this is very kludge-y and does not retain a working clone of this repo. Sorry!
This code just adds a few files to CondTools in CMSSW, so until it's incorporated this will be a bit nasty. 

```Shell
setenv SCRAM_ARCH slc6_amd64_gcc630
cmsrel CMSSW_10_1_0
cd CMSSW_10_1_0/src/
cmsenv
git cms-addpkg CondTools
git cms-addpkg Configuration
git cms-addpkg Geometry
git cms-addpkg DataFormats
git clone https://github.com/eminizer/pixel_templates
cd pixel_templates
git checkout phase2_edits
cd ..
cp -r pixel_templates/ CondTools/* CondTools/
rmrf pixel_templates/CondTools 
scram b -j 20
```

Input Files
===========

1) Template and GenError Files
* These are produced by Prof. Morris Swartz at Johns Hopkins University
* Template files should be located by default in CondTools/SiPixel/data/, GenErr files in CondTools/SiPixel/generr_data (this can be changed via a command line option, see below). Usually when I run I leave both types of template inside the CondTools/SiPixel/data/directory and point both the template and generror code to the same place using a command line option.
* Template files should be named in the format "template_summary_zp????.out", GenErrs files as "generr_summary_zp????.out" (this is hardcoded currently so if it changes edits to the scripts will need to be made).

2) Map File
* This is a .csv file that maps detector locations to templates
* You can make this from a spreadsheet if you want
* An example of the format can be found at /CondTools/SiPixel/data/template_1D_IOV12/IOV12_map.csv
* The location of this file can be changed via a command line option, but it's currently set to the example above

Running
=======

Example commands
The output of these commands prints some useful information, including the location and template assignments for each detID, so it could be good to pipe it to a file if you want to double check.

1) Producing Template SQLite files
```Shell
cd CondTools/SiPixel/test
cmsRun SiPixelTemplateDBObjectUploader_cfg.py MagField=3.8 Year=2017 Version=1 Append=bugfix Map=../data/template1D_phase1_2017_IOV1/phase1_2017_IOV1_map.csv TemplateFilePath=CondTools/SiPixel/data/template1D_phase1_2017_IOV1
```
This will produce an SQLLite file called "SiPixelTemplateDBObject_phase1_38T_2017_v1_bugfix.db"

2) Producing GenError SQLite files
```Shell
cd CondTools/SiPixel/test
cmsRun SiPixelGenErrorDBObjectUploader_cfg.py MagField=3.8 Year=2017 Version=1 Append=bugfix Map=../data/template1D_phase1_2017_IOV1/phase1_2017_IOV1_map.csv GenErrFilePath=CondTools/SiPixel/data/template1D_phase1_2017_IOV1
```
This will produce an SQLLite file called "SiPixelGenErrorDBObject_phase1_38T_2017_v1_bugfix.db"

Command Line Options
====================

1) MagField: Magnetic field value in Tesla (not deciTesla, so "3.8" NOT "38")

2) Year: Current year for versioning

3) Version: Version number

4) Append: Anything to add to the end of the SQLite filenames, like "bugfix"

5) Map: Full path to the Map file mentioned above (this one does have a default, so if you've changed something, use this option)

6) GlobalTag: GlobalTag for data run (default is set for this one too, so change it if necessary)

7) Delimiter: The delimiter used in the .csv map file (default is a comma, ",")

8) Quotechar: The quotechar used in the .csv map file (default is double quotes, """)

9) (Template/GenErr)FilePath: The path to the directory holding the template/generr files (these are currently set to the defaults mentioned above)

10) useVectorIndices: Set to true if the input file is indexed [0,(N-1)] instead of [1,N]; ([1,N] is the default and corresponds to the pixel offline conventions)

Work to be Done
===============

1) Submit a pull request to CMSSW

2) Incorporate some sort of visualization of template/detID assignments
